# Simulating CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Python
</br>
• Build Python programs to:
– Implement classic CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, Round-Robin, Pri-
ority Scheduling, and Shortest Job First (SJF).
– Analyze metrics like average waiting time and context-switching overhead for
various workloads.
</br>
• Investigate:
– How different scheduling strategies impact real-world system performance in op-
erating systems, cloud services, and mobile devices.
– The trade-offs between simplicity, fairness, and system responsiveness in schedul-
ing design
