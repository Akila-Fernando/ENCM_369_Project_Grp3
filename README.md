### Simulating CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Python

#### • Build Python programs to: </br>
– Implement classic CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, Round-Robin, Priority Scheduling, and Shortest Job First (SJF). </br>
– Analyze metrics like average waiting time and context-switching overhead for various workloads.

#### • Investigate:
– How different scheduling strategies impact real-world system performance in operating systems, cloud services, and mobile devices. </br>
– The trade-offs between simplicity, fairness, and system responsiveness in scheduling design </br>
